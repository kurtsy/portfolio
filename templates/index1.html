            <h2>ADVANCE LOCAL</h2>
            <p>As the UX Designer at Advance Local, I facilitate collaboration between the design and product team. I strive to balance the needs of writers, readers, stakeholders, and developers by advocating for a human-centered design approach.</p>

            <h4>Project: Photo Galleries and Slideshows</h4>
            <p>My work on Advance Local's photo galleries and multimedia slideshows is a case study in the art of balancing a variety of requirements. Oftentimes, user experience design is shown by a venn diagram with "UX" perfectly situated between the business and the user needs. But what happens when the business has more than one set of users and those users have competing needs? Rather than introducing another circle to the diagram, I've found that aligning a company's success metric around a unified user will result in a better user experience. And, sometimes, that "success metric" isn't a single number. Sometimes it's not a number at all.</p> 
            <p>When I started at Advance, I was put in charge of their recently redesigned photo gallery and multimedia slideshow experiences. The designer before me had done an amazing job identifying a subpar design and making it better. The company moved away from a clickbait gallery structure into a scrollable experience. But people weren't getting into the new galleries. Now that we were getting users into the galleries, we had to deal with the quality of the experience as readers consuemd content. Through unmoderated remote user testing, I discovered that many users were uncovering bloated galleries. never reaching the bottom? Why were readers being subjected to redundant galleries? and competitive analysis. galleries and slideshows were too long. The cont. Why were slideshows become so long? Was there something we could do to motivate producers and writers to create higher q</p>
            <p>The design trip took a trip to . This one-on-one interview iwht a producer . They were building around ads. As is the case</p>
            <p>We returned. This wuld need to be solved in the admin tool. Luckily I acted as a facilitsro duinr the sprin</p>
            <p>Once the admin tool was realized, we noticed an improveemtn in user reactions<p>
