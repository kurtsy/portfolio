            <h2>ADVANCE LOCAL</h2>
            <p>As the UX Designer at Advance Local, I facilitate collaboration between the design and product team. I strive to balance the needs of writers, readers, stakeholders, and developers by advocating for a human-centered design approach.</p>
            <img src="static/img/advance.jpg" alt="photo gallery experience">
            <h4>Project: Photo Galleries and Slideshows</h4>
            <p>My work on Advance Local's photo galleries and multimedia slideshows is a case study in the art of balancing a variety of requirements. Oftentimes, user experience design is shown by a venn diagram with "UX" perfectly situated between the business and the user needs. But what happens when the business has more than one set of users and those users have competing needs? Rather than introducing another circle to the diagram, I've found that aligning a company's success metric around a unified goal will result in a better user experience. And, sometimes, that "success metric" isn't a single number. Sometimes it's not a number at all.</p>
            <img src="static/img/advance1.jpg" alt="photo gallery experience">
            <p>When I started at Advance, I was put in charge of their recently redesigned photo gallery and multimedia slideshow experiences. The company decided to move away from a clickbait gallery structure into a more seamless, scrollable experience. Readers enjoyed the design much more, but they weren't clicking into the new galleries because of the way they were embedded on the homepage.</p>
            <img src="static/img/advance2.png" alt="photo gallery experience">
            <p>My first task was to improve the photo gallery signifier with a new layout. I ran A/B tests to determine which designs caused the most click-through-rates. I created a collage design that increased the total CTR by one percent.</p>
             <img src="static/img/advance3.png" alt="photo gallery experience">
            <p>Now that we were getting users into the galleries, we had to deal with the quality of the experience as readers consumed content. Through unmoderated remote user testing, I discovered that many users were frustrated by bloated galleries. Not only were they expressing disdain for the redundancy of content, many never reached the bottom. Why were readers being subjected to overwhelming galleries? Why were slideshows so long? The design team took a trip to NJ.com's offices to inteview digital producers. My one-on-one interview with an editor revealed that writers were adding additional slides to photo galleries to increase the total number of pageviews each gallery receieved. Pageviews were measured by the number of ads shown in a gallery rather than the number of visits the content receieved. Producters were building around ads instead of the quality of content.</p>
            <img src="static/img/advance4.png" alt="photo gallery experience">
            <p>We returned to Advance's headquarters and planned a design sprint to make the photo gallery creation process easier and fail-proof. We invited producers to the office to collaborate in reimagining their admin tool. We came up with an easy way for producers that increased the efficieny of creating a gallery without allowing them to add additional empty slides in order to inflate their pageview numbers.</p>
            <img src="static/img/advance5.jpg" alt="photo gallery experience">
            <p>The work didn't end at the design solutions. We presented our findings about producers hacking the galleries for a single metric to stakeholders and convinced them to change the metric. We shifted their focus and incentive into engaging content, rather than revenue. Once the admin tool was realized, we noticed an improvement in user reactions when navigating through the new content.<p>
